# AstroVia Favicon Implementation
# This file should be replaced with an actual ICO file
# The favicon should be based on the AstroVia logo with:
# - Stylized planet with rings (purple/blue)
# - Orange/red meteor with glowing tail
# - White "ASTROVIA" text on dark background
# - 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixel sizes
# - Optimized for small display sizes

# For now, the browser will use the apple-touch-icon as fallback
# which is configured to use /brand/astrovia-mark.webp
